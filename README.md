Counsellor Bot

A mini side project I did, based on another bot I worked on previously (The genZ bot),the counsellor bot. 

Project description:-
A basic chatbot which gives the user help and advice when in tough times, a helpful friend, a counsellor even. I build a basic interface which provides a text field for the user to give input questions and on the left side there is a field which provides the output.

Technologies and components used:-
Groq API is used to build the chat bot along with gradio for interface

Installation:-
pip install gradio groq

Run:-
run "python app.py" in terminal
